# How to download the required data


## Generic process
Each dataset to be processed by archimate-py needs to live in the [data directory](https://github.com/samperd/archimate-py/tree/master/data). In order to avoid licensing issues no data is distributed with this project so each dataset will need to be downloaded seprately.

The [resources](./resources.xml) file contains an entry for each dataset.
